{"name":"Marv","tagline":"  A toolkit for bootstrapping and developing WordPress themes using Sass, LESS, and CoffeeScript.","body":"## What is Marv?\r\n\r\nMarv is a free command-line toolkit for bootstrapping and developing WordPress themes in a tidy environment using front-end languages like Sass, LESS, and CoffeeScript.\r\n\r\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/marv.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/marv)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nMarv creates a neatly organized source folder with clean and simple scaffolding (base template files, SCSS files). The source folder is automatically compiled to your local WordPress install(s) as you save changes and work on your theme. When you are ready to distribute your theme Marv will build it to a folder of your choice or bundle the theme up into an easy to install zip package.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why use Marv?\r\n\r\nMarv accelerates development by giving you access to higher-level languages like Sass, LESS, and CoffeeScript. These languages are much quicker and cleaner to code, but still compile to normal CSS and JavaScript. Marv also makes it easy to quickly bootstrap into and a more modular development environment, while still compiling \"by the book\" WordPress theme code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Basic setup\r\n\r\nInstall Marv (requires [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/)):\r\n\r\n    $ gem install marv\r\n\r\nCreate your new theme project:\r\n\r\n    $ marv create themename\r\n\r\nLink to your WordPress theme folder:\r\n\r\n    $ marv link /wordpress/wp-content/themes/my-theme\r\n\r\nWatch for changes and start developing!\r\n\r\n    $ cd themename\r\n    $ marv watch\r\n\r\n\tPress Ctrl + Z to exit watch mode\r\n\r\nBuild your theme into the build_here directory:\r\n\r\n    $ marv build build_here\r\n\r\nPackage your theme as themename.zip:\r\n\r\n    $ marv package themename\r\n\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\nGet a little help with the Marv commands:\r\n\r\n    $ marv help\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the [user's manual](https://github.com/hardpixel/marv/wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nMarv is based on [Forge](https://github.com/thethemefoundry/forge) by ThemeFoundry.\r\n\r\nScaffold Wordpress theme is based on [WP-Scaffold](https://github.com/gizburdt/wp-scaffold) by Gizburdt.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
